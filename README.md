# Markov Chain Text Generation

This project demonstrates text generation using a **Markov Chain** model. The model generates new text based on input text by learning the patterns and sequences of words in the provided text. The Markov Chain builds the transitions between words using **n-grams** and generates new text based on these transitions.

## Project Overview

The project is built using Python and **ipywidgets** for an interactive user interface in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**. Users can input their own text and configure parameters such as the **n-gram size** and the **length of generated text**.

### Key Features:
- **Markov Chain Text Generation**: Generate text based on the input text and Markov Chain principles.
- **Interactive Widgets**: Customize text generation by adjusting the n-gram size and the length of the generated text using widgets.
- **Stylish UI**: Custom neon-styled interface for an engaging user experience.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **ipywidgets** (for the interactive user interface)
- **IPython** (for rendering HTML and widgets)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab** (for executing the notebook)

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install ipywidgets
